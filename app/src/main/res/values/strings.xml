    <string name="des">The basal metabolic rate (BMR) represents the amount of energy your body requires while at rest in a neutral environment, with the digestive system inactive. Think of it like the fuel an idle car consumes while parked. In this state, energy is used solely to maintain vital organs, including the heart, brain, kidneys, nervous system, intestines, liver, lungs, reproductive organs, muscles, and skin. For most people, approximately 70% of daily energy expenditure comes from this basic upkeep. Physical activity accounts for about 20%, and around 10% is used for digesting food, known as thermogenesis.
        \n\n
<b>Mifflin-St Jeor Equation:</b>\n
For men:\n
BMR = 10W + 6.25H - 5A + 5\n\n
For women:\n
BMR = 10W + 6.25H - 5A - 161\n</string>
